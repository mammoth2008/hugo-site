No, work should be fulfilling actually, work should be good for the environment, good for the people, it should form community, and it should be the backbone for society.

不，工作实际上应该是令人满足的，工作应该对环境、对人们有益，应该形成社区，应该是社会的支柱。

But you MUST go through the struggle to truly master your desires.

但你必须经历挣扎才能真正掌控你的欲望。

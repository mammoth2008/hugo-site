I learned something on the train ride home

我在回家的火车上学到了一些东西

Tonight as I was taking my seat on the train, I glanced at a girl’s phone and saw she was scrolling tiktok. So was the woman sitting in front of her. I looked around at the rest of the passengers I could see and 7 out of 12 were on their phones.

今晚当我坐上火车，我瞥了一眼一个女孩的手机，看到她在刷 tiktok。她前面的女人也在刷。我环顾四周，我能看到的乘客中，有 7 个人在用手机。

It made me think of this subreddit and I decided to spend the ride just with my thoughts and my music.

这让我想起了这个 subreddit，我决定在这次旅程中只和我的思绪和音乐为伴。

The 4 other people who weren’t on their phones were doing all sorts of things. One guy was sleeping. Another was talking on the phone. Two teenagers were chatting about Demi Lovato and a camping trip. Everyone buried in their phone looked depressed.

剩下的 4 个没有用手机的人在做各种各样的事情。一个男生在睡觉。另一个在打电话。两个青少年在聊 Demi Lovato 和一次露营旅行。所有埋头玩手机的人都看起来很沮丧。

I’m definitely addicted to my phone, and tonight made me realize, again, how badly I want to change. How many others have had a moment like this? Does everyone reach this kind of epiphany sooner or later?

我肯定对手机上瘾了，今晚又让我意识到，我有多么渴望改变。有多少人有过这样的时刻？是不是每个人迟早都会达到这样的顿悟？

Yes. I remember that moment very well. My realization moment came after I had already traded my smartphone for a Nokia flip phone.

是的。我非常清楚地记得那个时刻。我的顿悟是在我已经把智能手机换成诺基亚翻盖手机之后发生的。

The first Saturday without my smartphone, my wife and I were out for breakfast. After ordering, I typically would have been scrolling social media. But with no screen, I sat and watched almost every single customer in my line of sight doing exactly what I used to do.

没有智能手机的第一个星期六，我和妻子出去吃早餐。点餐的时候，我通常会在刷社交媒体。但是没有屏幕，我坐下来几乎看了我视线范围内的每一个顾客，他们都在做我以前做的事情。

It was heartbreaking to watch their blank stares, but mostly because that had been my behavior too for several years. I'm ashamed that I ignored my wife like that.

看着他们空洞的眼神，心里很不是滋味，主要是因为那曾经也是我几年的行为。我为自己那样忽视妻子而感到羞愧。

1 or 2 months ago, not soon after I started spending less time on my phone, I was in the library. I look over and see this girl on her phone, open like 10 apps in 20 seconds. Opened one app for a sec, then another, then another etc. Like muscle memory.

大约 1 或 2 个月前，在我开始减少手机使用时间不久后，我在图书馆。我抬头一看，看到这个女孩在玩手机，20 秒内打开了大约 10 个应用。打开一个应用几秒钟，然后另一个，然后另一个等等。就像肌肉记忆一样。

It was like she was bored but couldn’t put down her phone at the same time. That’s when I was like oh shit, society is cooked😅

她好像很无聊，但又无法放下手机。就在那时，我想，哦，社会完了😅

I went to the city (London) last year. Nearly every younger person pulled out their phone for any short esculator ride on the tube network. I thought maybe it's important work stuff that can't wait? No - insta / tik reels. Same for randoms just walking about.

我去年去了伦敦这座城市。几乎每个年轻人只要在地铁网络里短途乘坐，都会拿出手机。我想，或许这是不能等待的重要工作事务？不是——是 insa / tik reels。对那些随意行走的人来说也是如此。

I then had a guy mid 20's on the train home near me. He was cycling through the same half dozen apps over and over at breakneck speed for over an hour. Insta, Spotify, Tinder etc. 95% of people had their phones out for even the shortest of journeys. Necks hunched.

然后，我在回家的火车上旁边有个二十多岁的年轻人。他一个接一个地快速浏览着同一批六七个应用程序，持续了一个多小时。Instagram、Spotify、Tinder 等等。95%的人甚至在最短的路程中也会拿出手机。脖子弯曲。

For some reason this day cemented the idea that we're all in trouble and need to do something about it.

那天不知为何，这个想法变得更加坚定：我们都陷入了麻烦，需要采取行动。

We are actively frying our brains with the constant switching between apps. Our brains, our dear Stone Age brains, are not made for this technology.

我们正在通过不断切换应用程序来主动烧毁我们的大脑。我们的头脑，我们亲爱的石器时代头脑，并不适合这种技术。

For some reason this day cemented the idea that we're all in trouble and need to do something about it.

由于某种原因，这一天让我坚信我们都处于危险之中，我们需要采取行动。

Yup. Every day I'm reminded of this scene from WALL-E. It was a warning ... and almost twenty years later, it's a lifestyle.

是的。每天我都会想起《WALL-E》中的这个场景。这是一个警告……而现在，几乎 20 年后，它已经成为了一种生活方式。

The person talking on their phone was still on their phone. They were just engaging in an activity you approve of.

那个在打电话的人还在用手机。他们只是在进行你赞同的活动。

(Personally, I don't approve of taking non-emergency calls on public transportation, but I grew up in pre-cell phone days so that's just the etiquette I learned when I got my first one.)

（我个人并不赞同在公共交通工具上接非紧急电话，但我是在手机普及之前长大的，所以这就是我第一次得到手机时学到的礼仪。）

For all you know, those other passengers whose phone screens you couldn't see were reading ebooks or doing their grocery shopping or checking who in their family was picking up dinner.

你可能不知道，那些你看不见手机屏幕的其他乘客可能正在阅读电子书、做他们的杂货购物或者查看谁在接他们的晚餐。

They might have been tourists looking up directions or finding restaurants near their hotel. Maybe they were updating a digital diary because it's the only free moment they'll have. You have no way of knowing.

他们可能是游客，正在查找方向或寻找酒店附近的餐厅。也许他们正在更新数字日记，因为那可能是一天中唯一的空闲时间。你无从得知。

The reality is that phones can be incredibly useful tools. There's no reason to assume everyone who's using one is mindlessly scrolling for no apparent reason. Frankly even if they are, it's not actually any of your business. Worry about yourself.

现实是，手机可以是非常有用的工具。没有必要假设每个使用它的人都毫无目的地滑动屏幕。坦白说，即使他们是这样，这实际上也与你无关。关心你自己吧。

It's good practice for when you hit middle age and start wanting to complain about "kids today".

当你到了中年，开始想抱怨“现在的年轻人”时，这是一种好习惯。

THIS 🙌🏼 And even those "kids" who are scrolling through their phones, just want to connect with others in some way..they sharing every minute of their lifes or just managing their stress levels (schools these days are like slaughterhouses)- this is their way to decompress.I am not saying this is healthy,but when you see something you don't like and instead of doing something about it/inspiring others , you just complaining - thats not a good sign.I know it from my experience - If I start to do something and it makes me in some way better than others-of course I'm gonna criticize,complain, etc.If you are happy with your digital minimalism - you don't even need to say anything,people will see that you are calm,happy,inspired,doing your hobbies,whatever - they will ask : "hey u seem happy!

这🙌🏼甚至那些在手机上刷屏的“孩子”，也只是想以某种方式与他人建立联系……他们分享生活的每一刻，或者只是管理自己的压力水平（现在的学校就像屠宰场一样）——这是他们减压的方式。我并不是说这样健康，但当你看到你不喜欢的某件事，而不是采取行动/激励他人，只是抱怨——这可不是什么好兆头。我有经验——如果我开始做某件事，并且它以某种方式让我比别人更好，当然我会批评、抱怨等等。如果你对数字极简主义感到满意——你甚至不需要说什么，人们会看到你很平静、快乐、有灵感、做你的爱好等等——他们会问：“嘿，你看起来很开心！

What is your secret? and THEN you start to inspire them 😍🙌🏼 It is frustrating to see so many people cooking their brain on tik tok- it's addictive.At the same time - you can not change everyone 😮‍💨

你的秘诀是什么？然后你开始激励他们😍🙌🏼看到这么多人把大脑烧在 TikTok 上，真是令人沮丧。同时——你无法改变每个人😮‍💨

I'm super proud of you! THIS moment is very much the pivotal point on fixing the addiction. My moment was 2 years ago, and happened in a pub where everyone just stopped talking and looked at their phones for 20/30 minutes.

我非常为你感到骄傲！这个时刻正是解决上瘾问题的关键点。我的时刻是在两年前，发生在一个酒吧里，大家突然都停止了交谈，低头看了 20/30 分钟的手机。

It varies from person to person, but I am someone who needs to treat it like a full blown addiction and now I stick to a full on dumbphone. My logic is, an alcoholic wouldn't walk around with a small bottle of booze in their pocket!

每个人的情况都不一样，但对我来说，我需要把它当作一个严重的上瘾问题来对待，现在我坚持使用功能手机。我的逻辑是，一个酒鬼不会在口袋里装一小瓶酒！

Another guy posted earlier this week that using a dumbphone is like eating a meal at the table, and using a smartphone is like walking around all day with food in your hand. 😂

另一位用户在上周早些时候发帖说，使用功能手机就像在餐桌旁吃饭，而使用智能手机就像整天手里拿着食物走来走去。😂

My turning point 1 was burnout — just too much information, too many triggers, and constant overwhelm. That’s when I turned off most notifications and felt immediate relief. The next big shift was after the birth of my kids.

我的转折点 1 是过度劳累——信息太多，触发点太多，一直处于压力之下。那时我关闭了大部分通知，感到立即放松。下一个大的转变是在我孩子出生之后。

Now I’m even more intentional about how I use my phone, because I don’t want to just be next to them, I want to truly be with them. Presence feels more valuable than ever.

现在我对如何使用手机更加有意识，因为我不想只是陪在他们身边，我想真正地与他们在一起。存在感比以往任何时候都更有价值。

Where I live way more than 7 out of 12 people spend about 99% of their time gawping at their phones mindlessly when they're on the underground.

我住的地方，超过 12 人中的 7 人，在地铁上几乎 99%的时间都在无意识地盯着手机看。

Once you notice it you will notice it more and more and it will make you waste time on your phone less and less. Enjoy.. 😊

一旦你注意到它，你就会越来越注意到它，并且你会在手机上浪费的时间越来越少。享受吧.. 😊

“Art consists of limitation. The most beautiful part of every picture is the frame.”

The more constraints one imposes, the more one frees one’s self of the chains that shackle the spirit.”
― Igor Stravinsky, Poetics of Music in the Form of Six Lessons

伊戈尔·斯特拉文斯基 (Igor Stravinsky)

俄国作曲家，20世纪现代音乐的代表人物。

言论： "施加的约束越多，就越能解放自己。而约束的任意性只会为了获得执行的精确性。" (The more constraints one imposes, the more one frees one's self. And the arbitrariness of the constraint serves only to obtain precision of execution.)   

出处： 这句话出自斯特拉文斯基的著作《音乐诗学》(Poetics of Music)，他在其中阐述了自己的音乐创作理念。BrainyQuote 等网站也收录了这句话。

阐释： 斯特拉文斯基认为，创作者主动设定的规则和限制，反而能够帮助他们摆脱漫无目的的状态，更集中地探索可能性，从而实现更高的艺术精准度和自由度。

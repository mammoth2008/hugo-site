Catherine Garland, an astrophysicist, started seeing the problem in 2017. She was teaching an engineering course, and her students were using simulation software to model turbines for jet engines.

凯瑟琳·加兰德，一位 astrophysicist，开始在 2017 年看到这个问题。她正在教授一门工程课程，她的学生们正在使用模拟软件来建模喷气发动机的涡轮。

She’d laid out the assignment clearly, but student after student was calling her over for help. They were all getting the same error message: The program couldn’t find their files. 

她清楚地布置了作业，但一个接一个的学生都在叫她过来帮忙。他们都收到了相同的错误信息：程序找不到他们的文件。

Garland thought it would be an easy fix. She asked each student where they’d saved their project. Could they be on the desktop? Perhaps in the shared drive? But over and over, she was met with confusion. “What are you talking about?” multiple students inquired.

加兰德认为这会是一个简单的解决办法。她问每个学生他们把项目保存在哪里。可能在桌面上？也许在共享驱动器中？但一次又一次，她都遇到了困惑。“你在说什么？”多个学生询问。

Not only did they not know where their files were saved — they didn’t understand the question.

他们不仅不知道他们的文件保存在哪里——他们甚至不理解这个问题。

Gradually, Garland came to the same realization that many of her fellow educators have reached in the past four years: the concept of file folders and directories, essential to previous generations’ understanding of computers, is gibberish to many modern students.

逐渐地，Garland 意识到她的许多教育同事在过去四年中达成的相同认识：文件夹和目录的概念，对于前几代人理解计算机至关重要，但对许多现代学生来说却是无稽之谈。

“I open a drawer, and inside that drawer, I have another cabinet with more drawers.”

“我打开一个抽屉，里面还有一个带有更多抽屉的柜子。”

Professors have varied recollections of when they first saw the disconnect. But their estimates (even the most tentative ones) are surprisingly similar. It’s been an issue for four years or so, starting — for many educators — around the fall of 2017. 

教授们对他们第一次看到这种脱节的时间有不同的回忆。但他们的估计（即使是最初步的估计）却出奇地相似。这已经是一个问题大约四年了，对于许多教育工作者来说，始于 2017 年秋季左右。

That’s approximately when Lincoln Colling, a lecturer in the psychology department at the University of Sussex, told a class full of research students to pull a file out of a specific directory and was met with blank stares.

大约在那个时候，萨塞克斯大学心理学系的讲师林肯·科林告诉一班研究生从一个特定目录中提取一个文件，却遭遇了一片茫然的目光。

It was the same semester that Nicolás Guarín-Zapata, an applied physicist and lecturer at Colombia’s Universidad EAFIT, noticed that students in his classes were having trouble finding their documents. It’s the same year that [posts began to pop up on](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/3535/introducing-file-systems-to-students-who-really-dont-understand?noredirect=1&lq=1) [STEM-educator forums](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/5551/what-is-a-file?rq=1) asking for help explaining the concept of a file. 

正是在这个学期，哥伦比亚 EAFIT 大学的应用物理学家和讲师尼古拉斯·瓜林-萨帕塔注意到他的学生在寻找文件时遇到了困难。正是这一年，[在](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/3535/introducing-file-systems-to-students-who-really-dont-understand?noredirect=1&lq=1) [STEM 教育者论坛](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/5551/what-is-a-file?rq=1)上开始出现请求帮助解释文件概念的帖子。

Guarín-Zapata is an organizer. He has an intricate hierarchy of file folders on his computer, and he sorts the photos on his smartphone by category. He was in college in the very early 2000s — he grew up needing to keep papers organized.

瓜林-萨帕塔是一个组织者。他的电脑上有复杂的文件夹层级，他在智能手机上按类别整理照片。他在 2000 年代初上大学——他从小就需要保持文件的有序。

Now, he thinks of his hard drives like filing cabinets. “I open a drawer, and inside that drawer, I have another cabinet with more drawers,” he told *The Verge*. “Like a nested structure. At the very end, I have a folder or a piece of paper I can access.” 

现在，他把硬盘想象成文件柜。“我打开一个抽屉，里面还有一个有更多抽屉的柜子，”他告诉*The Verge*。“就像一个嵌套结构。在最里面，我有一个文件夹或一张我可以访问的纸。”

Guarín-Zapata’s mental model is commonly known as directory structure, the hierarchical system of folders that modern computer operating systems use to arrange files.

瓜林-萨帕塔的心理模型通常被称为目录结构，这是现代计算机操作系统用来组织文件的分层文件夹系统。

It’s the idea that a modern computer doesn’t just save a file in an infinite expanse; it saves it in the “Downloads” folder, the “Desktop” folder, or the “Documents” folder, all of which live within “This PC,” and each of which might have folders nested within them, too.

现代计算机的概念不仅仅是将文件保存在无限的空间中；它将文件保存在“下载”文件夹、“桌面”文件夹或“文档”文件夹中，这些文件夹都位于“此电脑”中，并且每个文件夹中可能还有嵌套的子文件夹。

It’s an idea that’s likely intuitive to any computer user who remembers the floppy disk.

这对于任何记得软盘的计算机用户来说，都是一个可能直观的想法。

More broadly, directory structure connotes physical placement — the idea that a file stored on a computer is *located* somewhere on that computer, in a specific and discrete location. That’s a concept that’s always felt obvious to Garland but seems completely alien to her students. “I tend to think an item lives in a particular folder.

更广泛地说，目录结构暗示了物理位置——即存储在计算机上的文件在该计算机上的某个特定且独立的位置*位于*某处。这个概念对加兰来说一直是显而易见的，但对她的学生来说似乎完全陌生。“我倾向于认为一个项目生活在一个特定的文件夹中。

It lives in one place, and I have to go to that folder to find it,” Garland says. “They see it like one bucket, and everything’s in the bucket.”

“它生活在一个地方，我必须去那个文件夹找它，”加兰德说。“他们把它看作一个桶，所有东西都在这个桶里。”

“As much as I want them to be organized and try for them to be organized, it’s just a big hot mess.”

“尽管我希望它们能够有序，并努力让它们有序，但这就是一团糟。”

That tracks with how Joshua Drossman, a senior at Princeton, has understood computer systems for as long as he can remember.

这与普林斯顿大学的高年级学生约书亚·德罗斯曼对计算机系统的理解相符，他记得自己对计算机系统的理解已经有很长时间了。

“The most intuitive thing would be the laundry basket where you have everything kind of together, and you’re just kind of pulling out what you need at any given time,” he says, attempting to describe his mental model. 

“最直观的就是洗衣篮，里面把所有东西都放在一起，你只需在任何时候拿出你需要的东西，”他说，试图描述他的思维模型。

As an operations research and financial engineering major, Drossman knows how to program — he’s been trained to navigate directories and folders throughout his undergraduate years, and he understands their importance in his field.

作为运筹学和金融工程专业的学生，德罗斯曼知道如何编程——在他的本科学习中，他接受过导航目录和文件夹的训练，并且他理解它们在他领域中的重要性。

But it’s still not entirely natural, and he sometimes slips. About halfway through a recent nine-month research project, he’d built up so many files that he gave up on keeping them all structured.

但这仍然不是完全自然的，有时他会出错。在最近的一个为期九个月的研究项目进行到一半时，他积累了太多文件，以至于放弃了保持它们结构化。

“I try to be organized, but there’s a certain point where there are so many files that it kind of just became a hot mess,” Drossman says. Many of his items ended up in one massive folder. 

“我尽量保持有条理，但有一个阶段文件太多，结果就变成了一团糟，”德罗斯曼说。他的许多文件最终都放在一个巨大的文件夹里。

Peter Plavchan, an associate professor of physics and astronomy at George Mason University, has seen similar behavior from his students and can’t quite wrap his head around it.

彼得·普拉夫昌，乔治·梅森大学的物理和天文学副教授，看到他的学生也有类似的行为，无法完全理解这一点。

“Students have had these computers in my lab; they’ll have a thousand files on their desktop completely unorganized,” he told *The Verge*, somewhat incredulously. “I’m kind of an obsessive organizer ... but they have no problem having 1,000 files in the same directory. And I think that is fundamentally because of a shift in how we access files.”

“学生们在我的实验室里使用这些电脑；他们的桌面上会有一千个完全没有组织的文件，”他有些难以置信地对*The Verge*说道。“我有点强迫症地喜欢整理……但他们在同一个目录下有一千个文件毫无问题。我认为这根本上是因为我们访问文件的方式发生了变化。”

Aubrey Vogel, a journalism major at Texas A&M, has had similar experiences to Drossman. She’s encountered directory structure before; she shared a computer with her grandfather, who showed her how to save items in folders, as a child.

奥布里·沃戈尔是德克萨斯农工大学的新闻专业学生，她的经历与德罗斯曼相似。她以前接触过目录结构；小时候，她和祖父共享一台电脑，祖父教她如何将物品保存在文件夹中。

But as she’s grown up, she’s moved away from that system — she now keeps one massive directory for schoolwork and one for her job. Documents she’s not sure about go in a third folder called “Sort.” 

但随着她的成长，她已经远离了那个系统——现在她为学业保留一个巨大的目录，为工作保留一个目录。她不确定的文件放在一个名为“分类”的第三个文件夹里。

“As much as I want them to be organized and try for them to be organized, it’s just a big hot mess,” Vogel says of her files. She adds, “My family always gives me a hard time when they see my computer screen, and it has like 50 thousand icons.” 

“尽管我希望它们能有条理，并努力让它们有条理，但这就是一团糟，”沃戈尔谈到她的文件时说。她补充道：“当我的家人看到我的电脑屏幕上有五万个图标时，总是会嘲笑我。”

2017’s college freshmen were in elementary school when the iPhone debuted; they’re around the same age as Google

2017 年的大学新生在 iPhone 首次发布时还在上小学；他们的年龄与谷歌大致相同

Why have mental models changed? Drossman, for his part, has no idea. “I don’t think I even thought about it at all when I first started using computers,” he says.

为什么心理模型会改变？德罗斯曼对此毫无头绪。“我想我在第一次使用计算机时根本没有考虑过这个问题，”他说。

It’s possible that the analogy multiple professors pointed to — filing cabinets — is no longer useful since many students Drossman’s age spent their high school years storing documents in the likes of OneDrive and Dropbox rather than in physical spaces.

多位教授提到的类比——文件柜——可能不再有用，因为许多与德罗斯曼同龄的学生在高中时期将文件存储在 OneDrive 和 Dropbox 等云端，而不是在实体空间中。

It could also have to do with the other software they’re accustomed to — dominant smartphone apps like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube all involve pulling content from a vast online sea rather than locating it within a nested hierarchy.

这也可能与他们习惯的其他软件有关——主流智能手机应用程序如 Instagram、TikTok、Facebook 和 YouTube 都涉及从广阔的在线海洋中提取内容，而不是在嵌套层次结构中定位内容。

“When I want to scroll over to Snapchat, Twitter, they’re not in any particular order, but I know exactly where they are,” says Vogel, who is a devoted iPhone user. Some of it boils down to muscle memory.

“当我想滑动到 Snapchat、Twitter 时，它们并没有特定的顺序，但我确切知道它们在哪里，”忠实的 iPhone 用户 Vogel 说。这其中有些归结于肌肉记忆。

But it may also be that in an age where every conceivable user interface includes a search function, young people have never needed folders or directories for the tasks they do. The first internet search engines were used [around 1990](https://mashable.com/article/first-search-engine-archie), but features like Windows Search and Spotlight on macOS are both products of the early 2000s. Most of 2017’s college freshmen were born in the very late ‘90s. They were in elementary school when the iPhone debuted; [they’re around the same age as Google](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17823490/google-20th-birthday-anniversary-history-milestones). While many of today’s professors grew up without search functions on their phones and computers, today’s students increasingly don’t remember a world without them.

但也可能在一个每个可想象的用户界面都包含搜索功能的时代，年轻人从未需要用于他们所做任务的文件夹或目录。第一批互联网搜索引擎大约在 [1990 年](https://mashable.com/article/first-search-engine-archie) 被使用，但像 Windows Search 和 macOS 上的 Spotlight 这样的功能都是 2000 年代初期的产物。2017 年大一新生大多数出生于 90 年代末。他们在 iPhone 首次亮相时还在上小学； [他们和 Google 差不多大](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/5/17823490/google-20th-birthday-anniversary-history-milestones)。虽然今天的许多教授在没有手机和电脑搜索功能的环境中成长，但今天的学生越来越不记得没有这些功能的世界。

“I grew up when you had to have a file; you had to save it; you had to know where it was saved. There was no search function,” says Saavik Ford, a professor of astronomy at the Borough of Manhattan Community College.

“我成长的时代，你必须有一个文件；你必须保存它；你必须知道它保存在哪里。没有搜索功能，”曼哈顿社区学院的天文学教授萨维克·福特说。

But among her students, “There’s not a conception that there’s a place where files live. They just search for it and bring it up.” She added, “They have a laundry basket full of laundry, and they have a robot who will fetch them every piece of clothing they want on demand.” ([Some companies](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18171441/foldimate-laundry-folding-robot-ces-2019) have actually played around with laundry-inclined robots, [to little result](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512529/laundroid-laundry-folding-robot-seven-dreamers-bankrupt-ces).) 

但在她的学生中，“没有人意识到有一个地方存放文件。他们只是搜索并调出它。”她补充道，“他们有一个装满衣物的洗衣篮，还有一个机器人可以根据需求为他们取来每一件衣服。”（[一些公司](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18171441/foldimate-laundry-folding-robot-ces-2019)实际上已经尝试过与洗衣相关的机器人，[但结果不大](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512529/laundroid-laundry-folding-robot-seven-dreamers-bankrupt-ces)。)

To a point, the new mindset may reflect a natural — and expected — technological progression. Plavchan recalls having similar disconnects with his own professors.

在某种程度上，这种新思维方式可能反映了一种自然的——也是预期中的——技术进步。普拉夫昌回忆起自己与教授之间也曾有过类似的脱节。

“When I was a student, I’m sure there was a professor that said, ‘Oh my god, I don’t understand how this person doesn’t know how to solder a chip on a motherboard,’” he says.

“当我还是学生的时候，我确信有位教授说过，‘天哪，我不明白这个人怎么会不知道如何将芯片焊接到主板上，’”他说。

“This kind of generational issue has always been around.” And though directory structures exist on every computer (as well as in environments like Google Drive), today’s iterations of macOS and Windows do an excellent job of hiding them.

“这种代际问题一直存在。”尽管每台计算机上都有目录结构（以及像 Google Drive 这样的环境中），但今天的 macOS 和 Windows 版本在隐藏这些结构方面做得非常出色。

(Your Steam games all live in a folder called “steamapps” — when was the last time you clicked on that?) Today’s virtual world is largely a searchable one; people in many modern professions have little need to interact with nested hierarchies. 

您的 Steam 游戏都存放在一个名为“steamapps”的文件夹中——您上次点击它是什么时候？今天的虚拟世界在很大程度上是一个可搜索的世界；许多现代职业的人们几乎不需要与嵌套层级进行互动。

But in STEM fields, directory structure remains crucially important. Astronomers, for example, may work with hundreds of thousands of files in the same format — which can be unwieldy to scale to a searchable system, Plavchan says.

但在 STEM 领域，目录结构仍然至关重要。例如，天文学家可能会处理成百上千个相同格式的文件——这在扩展到可搜索系统时可能会变得笨重，Plavchan 说。

The primary issue is that the code researchers write, run at the command line, needs to be told exactly how to access the files it’s working with — it can’t search for those files on its own.

主要问题是，代码研究人员编写的在命令行运行的代码需要明确指示如何访问它正在处理的文件——它无法自行搜索这些文件。

Some programming languages have search functions, but they’re difficult to implement and not commonly used. It’s in the programming lessons where STEM professors, across fields, are encountering problems. 

一些编程语言具有搜索功能，但它们难以实现且不常用。在编程课程中，各个领域的 STEM 教授正面临问题。

“They use a computer one way, and we use a computer another way. That’s where the problem is starting.”

“他们用电脑的方式和我们用电脑的方式不同。这就是问题开始的地方。”

Classes in high school computer science — that is, programming — are [on the rise](https://www.brookings.edu/research/what-do-we-know-about-the-expansion-of-k-12-computer-science-education/) globally. But that hasn’t translated to better preparation for college coursework in every case.

高中计算机科学课程——也就是编程——在全球范围内[正在增加](https://www.brookings.edu/research/what-do-we-know-about-the-expansion-of-k-12-computer-science-education/)。但这并不意味着在每种情况下都能更好地为大学课程做好准备。

Guarín-Zapata was taught computer basics in high school — how to save, how to use file folders, how to navigate the terminal — which is knowledge many of his current students are coming in without.

瓜林-萨帕塔在高中学习了计算机基础知识——如何保存、如何使用文件夹、如何导航终端——而他的许多现任学生却没有这些知识。

The high school students Garland works with largely haven’t encountered directory structure unless they’ve taken upper-level STEM courses.

加兰德所工作的高中生大多没有接触过目录结构，除非他们修过高级 STEM 课程。

Vogel recalls saving to file folders in a first-grade computer class, but says she was never directly taught what folders were — those sorts of lessons have taken a backseat amid a growing emphasis on[ “21st-century skills](https://journals.sagepub.com/keyword/21st-century+Skills)[”](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745499919829214) in the educational space

沃格尔回忆起在一年级的计算机课上保存文件夹，但她表示自己从未被直接教过文件夹是什么——这些类型的课程在教育领域日益强调[“21 世纪技能](https://journals.sagepub.com/keyword/21st-century+Skills)[”](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745499919829214)的背景下被搁置

A cynic could blame generational incompetence. An [international 2018 study](https://www.iea.nl/sites/default/files/2020-04/IEA International Computer and Information Literacy Study 2018 International Report.pdf) that measured eighth-graders’ “capacities to use information and computer technologies productively” proclaimed that just 2 percent of Gen Z had achieved the highest “digital native” tier of computer literacy. “Our students are in deep trouble,” [one educator wrote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/11/16/todays-kids-may-be-digital-natives-new-study-shows-they-arent-close-being-computer-literate/).

一个愤世嫉俗者可能会指责代际无能。一项[2018 年的国际研究](https://www.iea.nl/sites/default/files/2020-04/IEA International Computer and Information Literacy Study 2018 International Report.pdf)测量了八年级学生“有效使用信息和计算机技术的能力”，宣称只有 2%的 Z 世代达到了最高的“数字原住民”计算机素养等级。“我们的学生面临严重问题，”[一位教育工作者写道](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2019/11/16/todays-kids-may-be-digital-natives-new-study-shows-they-arent-close-being-computer-literate/)。

But the issue is likely not that modern students are learning fewer digital skills, but rather that they’re learning different ones.

但问题可能不是现代学生学习的数字技能更少，而是他们学习的技能不同。

Guarín-Zapata, for all his knowledge of directory structure, doesn’t understand Instagram nearly as well as his students do, despite having had an account for a year. He’s had students try to explain the app in detail, but “I still can’t figure it out,” he complains. 

瓜林-萨帕虽然对目录结构了解颇深，但对 Instagram 的理解远不如他的学生，尽管他已经拥有一个账户一年了。他曾让学生详细解释这个应用，但他抱怨说：“我还是搞不懂。”

“They use a computer one way, and we use a computer another way,” Guarin-Zapata emphasizes. “That’s where the problem is starting.”

“他们用电脑的方式和我们用电脑的方式不同，”Guarin-Zapata 强调。“这就是问题开始的地方。”

Ford agrees. “These are smart kids,” she says. “They’re doing astrophysics. They get stuff. But they were not getting this.” 

福特同意。“这些孩子很聪明，”她说。“他们在学习天体物理。他们懂很多东西。但他们对此却不太明白。”

Regardless of source, the consequence is clear. STEM educators are increasingly taking on dual roles: those of instructors not only in their field of expertise but in computer fundamentals as well.

无论来源如何，结果是显而易见的。STEM 教育工作者越来越多地承担双重角色：不仅在他们的专业领域担任讲师，还在计算机基础知识方面担任讲师。

Colling’s courses now include a full two-hour lecture to explain directory structure. He likens finding files to giving driving directions. He shows maps of directory trees and asks his students to pretend they’re guiding others to a highlighted point.

科林的课程现在包括一个完整的两小时讲座来解释目录结构。他将查找文件比作给出驾驶指示。他展示了目录树的地图，并要求学生假装他们在引导其他人到一个突出显示的点。

He uses every analogy he can think of.

他用尽了他能想到的每一个类比。

“Take their phones away and get ‘em on Windows 98.”

“把他们的手机拿走，让他们使用 Windows 98。”

Plavchan now also spends a lot of time teaching his students about directory structure in his courses, along with other basics, like file extensions and terminal navigation. Guarín-Zapata begins his semesters with a similar tutorial.

普拉夫昌现在在他的课程中也花了很多时间教学生关于目录结构的知识，以及其他基础知识，比如文件扩展名和终端导航。瓜林-萨帕塔在他的学期开始时也会进行类似的教程。

“I start with a little talk about a mental model of a computer, what a computer is,” he says. “We have memory; we have a hard drive; we have an interface; we have a file structure.”

“我先谈谈计算机的心理模型，计算机是什么，”他说。“我们有内存；我们有硬盘；我们有接口；我们有文件结构。”

It’s a difficult concept to get across, though. Directory structure isn’t just unintuitive to students — it’s *so* intuitive to professors that they have difficulty figuring out how to explain it. “Those of us who have been around a while *know* what a file is, but I was at a bit of a loss to explain it,” lamented one educator in [a 2019 forum post](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/5551/what-is-a-file?rq=1), a sentiment that respondents shared. Ford put out a [call for useful analogies](https://twitter.com/saavikford/status/1425235203308535808) on Twitter and was met with various suggestions: [physical tree branches and leaves](https://twitter.com/PrieneV/status/1425442829598445569), [kitchen utensils sorted into drawers](https://twitter.com/akiroberge/status/1425494357600317448), [books and shelves in a library](https://twitter.com/markmadsen/status/1425502956825178115), “Take their phones away and get ‘em on Windows 98.” 

这是一个难以传达的概念。目录结构对学生来说不仅不直观——对教授来说却是*如此*直观，以至于他们很难找到解释的方法。“我们这些在这个领域待了很久的人*知道*什么是文件，但我有点不知如何解释，”一位教育工作者在[2019 年的论坛帖子](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/5551/what-is-a-file?rq=1)中感叹，这种感受得到了回应。福特在推特上发出[寻找有用类比的呼吁](https://twitter.com/saavikford/status/1425235203308535808)，收到了各种建议：[物理树枝和树叶](https://twitter.com/PrieneV/status/1425442829598445569)、[厨房用具分类放入抽屉](https://twitter.com/akiroberge/status/1425494357600317448)、[图书馆中的书籍和书架](https://twitter.com/markmadsen/status/1425502956825178115)，“把他们的手机拿走，让他们用 Windows 98。”

But even after presenting students with every metaphor in the books, Colling still isn’t positive that his students get what he’s talking about: “It feels like I’m having some success, but yeah, sometimes it’s hard to tell,” he says. 

但即使在向学生们展示书中的每一个隐喻后，科林仍然不确定他的学生是否理解他所说的：“我感觉我有一些成功，但有时很难判断，”他说。

Plavchan agrees that there are limits to how much he can bridge the generational divide. Despite his efforts to tailor his teaching, “some of the tools we use rely on some knowledge that our students just aren’t getting.”

普拉夫昌同意，他在弥合代沟方面是有局限的。尽管他努力调整自己的教学，“我们使用的一些工具依赖于学生们根本没有掌握的一些知识。”

Others, meanwhile, believe it’s professors who need to adjust their thinking. Working with befuddled students has convinced Garland that the “laundry basket” may be a superior model.

其他人则认为，教授需要调整他们的思维。与困惑的学生一起工作使加兰德相信“洗衣篮”可能是一个更好的模型。

She’s begun to see the limitations of directory structure in her personal life; she uses her computer’s search function to find her schedules and documents when she’s lost them in her stack of directories. “I’m like, huh ... I don’t even need these subfolders,” she says.

她开始意识到目录结构在个人生活中的局限性；当她在一堆目录中找不到日程和文件时，她会使用电脑的搜索功能。“我想，嗯……我根本不需要这些子文件夹，”她说。

Even professors who have incorporated directory structure into their courses suspect that they may be clinging to an approach that’s soon to be obsolete. Plavchan has considered offering a separate course on directory structure — but he’s not sure it’s worth it.

即使是那些将目录结构纳入课程的教授也怀疑他们可能在坚持一种即将过时的方法。普拉夫昌曾考虑开设一门关于目录结构的独立课程——但他不确定这是否值得。

“I imagine what’s going to happen is our generation of students ... they’re going to grow up and become professors, they’re going to write their own tools, and they’re going to be based on a completely different approach from what we use today.”

“我想接下来会发生的是我们这一代学生……他们会长大成为教授，他们会编写自己的工具，而这些工具将基于与我们今天使用的完全不同的方法。”

His advice to fellow educators: Get ready. “This is not gonna go away,” he says. “You’re not gonna go back to the way things were. You have to accept it. The sooner that you accept that things change, the better.” 

他的建议给同事教育工作者：做好准备。“这不会消失，”他说。“你们不会回到过去的样子。你必须接受这一点。越早接受事物变化，越好。”

什么是文件？

### [What is a file? 什么是文件？](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/5551/what-is-a-file)

[Ask Question](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/ask)

Modified [2 years, 10 months ago](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/5551/what-is-a-file?lastactivity)

I recently had a student in my Intro to CS class ask me: what is a file? I can't honestly say I had a good answer for him. Those of us who have been around a while *know* what a file is, but I was at a bit of a loss to explain it to a novice.

我最近在我的计算机科学入门课上有一个学生问我：什么是文件？我不能诚实地说我有一个好的答案给他。我们这些在这个领域待了一段时间的人*知道*什么是文件，但我有点不知道如何向一个新手解释。

Today's students believe (and rightfully so) that a file is an icon-thingy in a folder or on the Desktop.

今天的学生认为（而且这是正确的）文件是文件夹或桌面上的一个图标。

They have some vague idea that there are files for images (JPEG, GIF, PSD, etc.), files for music (MP3, WAV), files for doing office stuff (docx, pptx, etc.), and maybe even HTML files. But they don't know what's *in* a file. That's where I kind of stumbled around for a few minutes because I didn't have a good answer prepared, nor a really good demonstration.

他们对图像文件（JPEG、GIF、PSD 等）、音乐文件（MP3、WAV）、办公文件（docx、pptx 等）以及可能还有 HTML 文件有一些模糊的概念。但他们不知道文件中*包含*什么。这就是我在几分钟内有些困惑的地方，因为我没有准备好一个好的答案，也没有一个很好的演示。

Looking back, I think I might have shown him what a text file looks like using a hex editor. Maybe also a simple image format such as PBM or BMP. I searched around on YouTube for a good video, but found pretty much nothing.

回想起来，我想我可能用十六进制编辑器给他展示过文本文件的样子。也许还展示过像 PBM 或 BMP 这样的简单图像格式。我在 YouTube 上搜索了一个好的视频，但几乎什么都没找到。

If you've been asked this question before, what's your answer? What *is* a file?

如果你以前被问过这个问题，你的答案是什么？一个*文件*是什么？

[Barry Brown](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/users/6704/barry-brown)

Long answer later, if a better one don't show up sooner. To answer the question, next time, just grab a file, or folder, out of your desk and show them a "file." English, German, binary, hex, or Martian, is merely the "encoding."

稍后会有更长的回答，如果没有更好的答案出现的话。为了回答这个问题，下次只需从你的桌子上拿出一个文件或文件夹，给他们展示一个“文件”。英语、德语、二进制、十六进制或火星语，仅仅是“编码”。

- Files are what file systems manage. File systems have state & operators. Operators suggest certain abstractions for what a "file" is. And the documentation explains the abstraction.

文件是文件系统管理的对象。文件系统具有状态和操作符。操作符为“文件”的某些抽象提供了建议。文档解释了这种抽象。 

I would approach this pragmatically, beginning with the metaphor that kicked it off. I would tell the students something like this:

我会以务实的态度来处理这个问题，从最初的隐喻开始。我会告诉学生们类似这样的话：

Imagine that it's 1925, and you're working at a giant company like General Electric as a secretary. There are files, meaning pieces of paper, for all kinds of things.

想象一下，现在是 1925 年，你在像通用电气这样的大公司担任秘书。这里有各种各样的文件，也就是纸张。

Personnel files about employees, files of record for payments, files of company policies, board meetings, tax documents, you make it. There are hundreds of rooms holding thousands of file cabinets holding millions of files in hanging folders.

员工的人事档案、支付记录文件、公司政策文件、董事会会议记录、税务文件，您可以制作。这里有数百个房间，存放着成千上万的文件柜，里面有数百万份悬挂文件。

So the metaphor of a file, then, is a document with some information about something. And the metaphor for the folder is as a place to store those files.

因此，文件的隐喻是一个包含某些信息的文档。而文件夹的隐喻则是存储这些文件的地方。

We also call these folders "directories", another metaphor. A "directory" is from the same etmological root as direction, and it means "to guide". So, folders can be thought of as places where files sit, or can be thought of as a guide to where files are.

我们也称这些文件夹为“目录”，这是另一个比喻。“目录”与“方向”有相同的词源，意思是“引导”。因此，文件夹可以被视为文件存放的地方，或者可以被视为指引文件所在位置的工具。

But translating that idea to the very alien mind of a computer involves some tweaks. First there's the idea that folders can contain folders, which can contain more folders still.

但将这个想法转化为计算机这种非常陌生的思维方式需要一些调整。首先是文件夹可以包含文件夹，而这些文件夹还可以包含更多的文件夹。

This is incredibly convenient, and using the same metaphor as "directory", we call the list of folders and subfolders and subfolders that bring us to a particular file as a "path". Get it?

这非常方便，使用与“目录”相同的比喻，我们将带我们到特定文件的文件夹、子文件夹和子文件夹的列表称为“路径”。明白了吗？

As for the files themselves, there are two perspectives to think about this. Again, the metaphor is there, but it breaks apart a bit in translation:

至于文件本身，有两个角度可以考虑这个问题。再一次，隐喻在这里，但在翻译中有些破裂：

The first is from the file system, which is concerned with being able to store and retrieve these files. As far as the file system is concerned, a file is a size and a series of locations as to where the various parts of the file are stored.

第一个来自文件系统，它关注的是能够存储和检索这些文件。就文件系统而言，文件是一个大小和一系列位置，指的是文件的各个部分存储在哪里。

This is because the files don't have to be contiguous inside the computer.

这是因为文件在计算机内部不必是连续的。

It doesn't actually matter if the first half is stored over here in the hard drive and the second half is stored somewhere else, since the file system will retrieve it for us as if it were one document anyway.

实际上，第一部分存储在硬盘上而第二部分存储在其他地方并没有关系，因为文件系统会像处理一个文档一样为我们检索它。

The file system just has to keep track of everything so that the files can be assembled properly when they are needed.

文件系统只需跟踪所有内容，以便在需要时能够正确组装文件。

The second perspective is the perspective of a file itself, which is really just some way to store some data, after all. So far, that's just like a file in our big office. But our files can store so many different kinds of data! We aren't just storing readable text.

第二个视角是文件本身的视角，毕竟这只是一种存储数据的方式。到目前为止，这就像我们大办公室里的一个文件。但我们的文件可以存储如此多种类的数据！我们不仅仅是在存储可读文本。

We can store pictures. We can store sounds. We can store runnable code. All of these require very different internal organizations, so the contents of files are extremely variable.

我们可以存储图片。我们可以存储声音。我们可以存储可运行的代码。所有这些都需要非常不同的内部组织，因此文件的内容极其多样。

Many files begin with some sort of metadata. "Hey, I'm a picture, and this is my encoding and my color depth and my size and and and and...". Some files depend on the file system to just remember what kind of files they are.

许多文件以某种元数据开始。“嘿，我是一张图片，这是我的编码、我的色深和我的大小等等……”。一些文件依赖于文件系统来记住它们是什么类型的文件。

Every file is designed to be read by programs or by the computer itself, and is highly organized to make this possible.

每个文件都是为了被程序或计算机本身读取而设计的，并且高度组织以实现这一点。

So, a "file" means different things in different contexts, and the only overriding idea is that a file is a way to group data together.

因此，“文件”在不同的上下文中意味着不同的东西，唯一的共同点是文件是一种将数据组合在一起的方式。

Everything in computing is either a container or something that goes in a container. Because everything in our minds is either a concept, or an instance of a concept. The hardest thing is coming up with so many names for stuff that never did exist in the first place.

计算中的一切要么是一个容器，要么是放入容器中的东西。因为我们脑海中的一切要么是一个概念，要么是一个概念的实例。最难的事情是为那些本来就不存在的东西想出这么多名称。

The question is actually quite deep. For instance, I'm sure you've heard the phrase "[everything is a file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file)," that is associated with a design of Unix operating system. So, the answer could be puzzling "a file is almost everything in Unix," for example devices can "look like" files to some processes. They use a file as a common interface between many processes.

这个问题实际上很深刻。例如，我相信你听过这个短语“[一切都是文件](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file)”，它与 Unix 操作系统的设计有关。因此，答案可能会让人困惑，“在 Unix 中，几乎一切都是文件”，例如设备可以对某些进程“看起来像”文件。它们使用文件作为多个进程之间的共同接口。

Hence, the file is quite a general notion of a sequence of bytes in Unix.

因此，文件在 Unix 中是一个相当普遍的字节序列的概念。

My simple answer would be that a file is a sequence of bytes with a reference to them, by which you can access these bytes.

我的简单回答是，文件是一系列字节的序列，并通过引用它们来访问这些字节。

I think in this case a short answer is better than a long one, which is harder, but I might give it a shot:

我认为在这种情况下，简短的回答比长回答更好，虽然这更难，但我可以试试看：

> A file is a list of bytes and an identifier [location].
> 文件是字节和标识符[位置]的列表。

Make sure to explain that there are no physical files and the term is just an abstraction. With my definition you can explain the following:

确保解释没有物理文件，这个术语只是一个抽象。根据我的定义，你可以解释以下内容：

- If you create a new file with a different identifier but the same bytes, it is a copy of the file.

如果您创建一个具有不同标识符但相同字节的新文件，它就是该文件的副本。

- If you just change the identifier [location], you say the file moves.

如果你只更改标识符[location]，你就说文件移动了。

- If you keep the identifier but change the bytes, the file is said to change.

如果你保留标识符但更改字节，则文件被认为已更改。

The identifier can be different - e.g. a filename ("C:\Desktop\MyFile.txt") or a URL ("https://www.mydomain.edu/MyFile.txt") - but the content is basically always a list of 0 to many bytes.

标识符可以不同 - 例如，文件名（"C:\Desktop\MyFile.txt"）或 URL（"https://www.mydomain.edu/MyFile.txt"） - 但内容基本上总是一个 0 到多个字节的列表。

You could go into details how files are stored and how HTTP works, but in the end you only need to explain the abstraction to understand what "file" means.

你可以详细讲解文件是如何存储的以及 HTTP 是如何工作的，但最终你只需要解释抽象概念，以理解“文件”是什么意思。

"File" is an abstraction. Even worse, we use it for different abstractions.

“文件”是一个抽象概念。更糟糕的是，我们将其用于不同的抽象。

Well, suppose I copy a file to this site, and you download it. Would you say it is the *same file*? What do you mean by *same*?

好吧，假设我把一个文件复制到这个网站上，然后你下载它。你会说这是*同一个文件*吗？你所说的*同一个*是什么意思？

Actually, we'll have, more or less, parts of our hard disks (or is it a floppy?) containing bytes which we understand (through the magic of operating systems) as a representation of the same informations.

实际上，我们的硬盘（或者是软盘？）中会有或多或少的部分包含我们通过操作系统的魔力理解为相同信息的字节。

- Hard disks are being replaced by solid state 'drives'. (What exactly is driving or driven? Even the words are abstracted away to absurdity.) And much of what we do is "in the cloud" now, so even talking about your computer doesn't apply anymore.

硬盘正在被固态“驱动器”取代。（究竟是什么在驱动或被驱动？甚至这些词都被抽象到荒谬的地步。）而我们所做的许多事情现在都是“在云端”，所以谈论你的电脑已经不再适用。 

- Hey, I have a dial telephone sitting on a shelf, but nothing to plug it in to. Give it a few years, then computers will no longer even have screens or keyboards, because most of what we need can be done with voice, as a million years of evolution sans reading has demonstrated.

嘿，我有一个拨号电话放在架子上，但没有地方可以插上它。再过几年，电脑甚至不再有屏幕或键盘，因为我们所需的大部分功能都可以通过语音完成，正如一百万年的进化没有阅读所证明的那样。

It is being done with voice, and increasingly will be. The question "what is a file?" will no longer have any referent, or anything to prompt it. Files and screens were a temporary phase, like telephone dials and switchboard operators.

这将通过语音来完成，并且越来越多地会这样做。“什么是文件？”这个问题将不再有任何指代或任何提示。文件和屏幕只是一个临时阶段，就像电话拨号盘和接线员一样。 

Was in a conference the other day and someone was showing intercept security... A .exe file started with MZ. Why? Those are the initials of the man who created the first DOS executable file format. Many kinds of files have 'signatures' in the first few bytes.

前几天参加了一个会议，有人展示了拦截安全……一个以 MZ 开头的.exe 文件。为什么？那是创建第一个 DOS 可执行文件格式的人的名字首字母。许多类型的文件在前几个字节中都有“签名”。

I used to use a tool called 'strings' that would show any displayable sequences of characters in an otherwise 'binary' file. Helpful sometimes.

我以前使用过一个叫做“strings”的工具，它可以显示在其他“二进制”文件中任何可显示的字符序列。有时很有帮助。

We have gotten far away from this level of reality in our everyday use of computers, so it is good to show that there is really no mystery, it is all just a heap of ideas people have had over time, piled up in layers. Start at the bottom with characters and follow the clues.

我们在日常使用计算机时已经远离了这种现实层面，因此展示其实没有什么神秘之处是很好的，这只不过是人们随着时间积累的想法，层层堆叠。从底层的字符开始，跟随线索。

Attack it in many ways, showing the aspects of 'files' that are meaningful to you. Give some of the history. I am sure you can come up with analogies. One issue is that although 'file' makes some sense, 'folder' does not, because we don't ever nest manila folders! Nnnnt!

以多种方式攻击它，展示对你有意义的“文件”的各个方面。提供一些历史。我相信你可以想出类比。一个问题是，虽然“文件”有一定的意义，但“文件夹”就没有，因为我们从来不会嵌套牛皮纸文件夹！Nnnnt！

The other term, 'directory', has fallen in to disuse, and really is not any better.

另一个术语“目录”已经不再使用，实际上也没有更好。

What is a synonym for what we call folder...? There isn't one! It is a brand new concept, like variables. Nothing else in our world is like that. This is why we have to show that analogies are limited and misleading. You have to actually *know* some things.

什么是我们所称的文件夹的同义词...? 没有一个！这是一个全新的概念，就像变量一样。我们世界上没有其他东西是这样的。这就是为什么我们必须表明类比是有限的且具有误导性的。你必须真正地*知道*一些事情。

And how many of the students have seen a manila folder? A floppy? A dial phone? They have no experience with the things we analogize *from*! Lost beyond lost in a hall of mirrors.

有多少学生见过马尼拉文件夹？软盘？拨号电话？他们对我们类比的事物毫无经验*来自*！在镜子迷宫中迷失得无影无踪。 

@LogicalBranch Sure. Humans usually make meaning by relating to things in their environment. The floppy disk is the icon for 'store' because they used to be commonplace. But to someone who has never seen one, it doesn't have any inherent meaning.

@LogicalBranch 当然。人类通常通过与环境中的事物建立联系来赋予意义。软盘是“存储”的象征，因为它曾经是很常见的。但对从未见过它的人来说，它没有任何固有的意义。

If a student is asking what a file is, it probably means they have no referent, no commonplace objects, situations and processes that they can intuitively substitute.

如果学生在问什么是文件，这可能意味着他们没有参照物，没有可以直观替代的常见物体、情境和过程。

If all of computing is strewn with metaphors and references to never-before-known things, it is basically like going to a foreign planet and trying to start from nothing.

如果所有的计算都充满了隐喻和对未知事物的引用，那基本上就像是去一个外星球，从零开始。 

Beyond, that, the references seem pointless and strained. Floppies only make sense without an internet. And if your entire life experience is that the internet has always just "been there", how can any other scenario make any sense?

除此之外，这些引用似乎毫无意义且牵强。软盘只有在没有互联网的情况下才有意义。如果你整个生活经历都是互联网一直“存在”，那么其他任何情境又怎么能有意义呢？

If I put you down in the Amazon rainforest and said, "There is lots of food here. Just watch out for the dangerous things." would you be likely to survive even for 2 days, or know what killed you in your sleep? No.

如果我把你放在亚马逊雨林里，并说：“这里有很多食物。只要小心危险的东西。”你能在这里生存两天，或者知道是什么在你睡觉时杀了你吗？不。

This is the world we put our children in to with no preparation, because we cannot see it from their point of view.

这是我们把孩子放入的世界，没有任何准备，因为我们无法从他们的角度看待它。 

Sure. This is why I keep crying like the little voice in the wilderness: "We have to start with the the basic level of how things *actually work*!" And everyone here says I am wrong. We shall see. Wait... We are seeing now.

当然。这就是为什么我像荒野中的小声音一样不停哭泣：“我们必须从事物 *实际运作* 的基本层面开始！”而这里的每个人都说我错了。我们拭目以待。等等……我们现在正在看到。 

Nothing wrong with citing all the "dictionary" definitions found on the Internet.

引用互联网上所有“词典”定义没有任何问题。

I'd add that a file tends to be the lowest level of abstraction of a container or boundary around data that the Operating System manages.

我想补充一点，文件往往是操作系统管理的数据容器或边界的最低抽象层。

That is the file's name is accessed through the OS and if you want to know the bits and bytes of data "in" the file you need an Application or program to read/write the file.

该文件的名称是通过操作系统访问的，如果您想了解文件中的数据位和字节，您需要一个应用程序或程序来读取/写入该文件。

The OS "promises" to return the data to any Application in the same order in which the creating Application specified but physically the OS may scatter the data to the wind - as long as the OS can return the data properly to some Application.

操作系统“承诺”以创建应用程序指定的顺序将数据返回给任何应用程序，但实际上操作系统可能会将数据分散到各处——只要操作系统能够正确地将数据返回给某个应用程序。

- Right, the OS exists basically to manage files and launch programs.

对，操作系统基本上是用来管理文件和启动程序的。 

*As is the case with most simplified explanation, I have glossed over some more advanced specific details that don't factor into the basics on file systems.

与大多数简化解释一样，我略过了一些更高级的具体细节，这些细节与文件系统的基础知识无关。*

## File content 文件内容

At its most basic level, a file is really just **a sequence of ones and zeroes**. It's data. There's nothing more to it than that.

在最基本的层面上，文件实际上只是 **一串零和一**。它是数据。仅此而已。

This data can then be interpreted. We (or an application) take the ones and zeroes, attribute meaning to them, and this interpretation is informative to us (or an application).

这些数据可以被解释。我们（或一个应用程序）将这些零和一赋予意义，这种解释对我们（或一个应用程序）是有信息价值的。

"Interpretation" is the operative keyword here. The same arbitrary sequence of ones and zeroes can be interpreted in any way you want to. However, in most cases only one interpretation will make sense, and other interpretation will look like garbage.

“解释”是这里的关键字。相同的任意一串零和一可以以你想要的任何方式进行解释。然而，在大多数情况下，只有一种解释是有意义的，其他解释看起来就像垃圾。

So how do we know which interpretation should be used for which file? Answer: the **file extension**. A file extension denotes how the data in the file is structured, and therefore how it can be sensically interpreted.

那么我们如何知道哪个解释应该用于哪个文件呢？答案是 **文件扩展名**。文件扩展名表示文件中数据的结构，因此也决定了如何合理地解释它。

Your OS automates this process for you. Instead of you having to look at the extension and then find the correct application which can interpret your file in the way you need it to be interpreted, your OS automatically maps a given file extension to your preferred application.

您的操作系统为您自动化了这个过程。您不需要查看文件扩展名，然后找到可以以您需要的方式解释文件的正确应用程序，您的操作系统会自动将给定的文件扩展名映射到您首选的应用程序。

For example, you might configure Windows to open `.txt` files with WordPad, or Notepad, or Notepad++, or some application you wrote yourself. All of these application are capable of performing the interpretation that a `.txt` file needs.

例如，您可以配置 Windows 以使用 WordPad、记事本、Notepad++ 或您自己编写的某个应用程序打开 `.txt` 文件。所有这些应用程序都能够执行 `.txt` 文件所需的解释。

You can override this behavior. You can open a `.png` file in Notepad. It won't make sense, but what you are seeing is the result of a `.txt` interpretation being applied to a file whose data structure is that of a `.png`.

您可以覆盖此行为。您可以在记事本中打开一个 `.png` 文件。它可能没有意义，但您所看到的是将 `.txt` 解释应用于数据结构为 `.png` 的文件的结果。

`.txt` files are very easy to interpret. Ignoring encoding for now (let's assume ASCII), every byte (= 8 bits) of the ones and zeroes represents a single number, which in turn represents a single character.

`.txt` 文件非常容易解释。暂时忽略编码（假设为 ASCII），每个字节（= 8 位）的 1 和 0 代表一个单一的数字，而这个数字又代表一个单一的字符。

To really prove the point, you could do this manually. Let's say I want to store a text file containing `apple`. You can use an [ASCII table](http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html) to look up what the numeric representation of each character is.

要真正证明这一点，你可以手动进行。假设我想存储一个包含`apple`的文本文件。你可以使用一个[ASCII 表](http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html)来查找每个字符的数字表示。

```

a = 01100001

p = 01110000

p = 01110000

l = 01101100

e = 01100101

```

If you use your text editor of choice, set the encoding to ASCII, enter `apple` and save the file, the file's ones and zeroes will exactly be the sequence of binary digits I just listed.

如果您使用自己选择的文本编辑器，将编码设置为 ASCII，输入`apple`并保存文件，则文件的零和一将完全是我刚刚列出的二进制数字序列。

`.txt` is really easy, but file structures can get significantly more complex, to the point where it is no longer feasible for a human to manually interpret all the data. For example, even though a `.pdf `file might only contain text (to your eyes) just like a `.txt`, it actually stores a whole lot more data (text markup, file metadata, ...) and this makes it less than obvious to interpret the binary data ourselves.

`.txt` 实际上很简单，但文件结构可能会变得复杂到人类无法手动解释所有数据的地步。例如，即使一个 `.pdf ` 文件在你眼中可能只包含文本，就像一个 `.txt` 文件一样，它实际上存储了更多的数据（文本标记、文件元数据等），这使得我们自己解释二进制数据变得不那么明显。

But to prove the point on how you can interpret files in a non-text example, suppose you (as a teacher) want to track whether your students were present/absent every day of school.

但是为了证明如何在非文本示例中解释文件，假设你（作为老师）想要跟踪你的学生每天在校的出勤情况。

Assuming you have 16 students, you could track this using a very simple sequence of 16 binary digits:

假设你有 16 名学生，你可以使用一串非常简单的 16 个二进制数字来跟踪他们：

```

1111111111011111

```

Everyone was present that day, except student 11.

那天除了 11 号学生，其他人都在场。

Is this a good file format? Well, it's very efficient. But it also lacks context. There's an assumption on which students were in your class. There's no way to track justified absences, etc. To really cover all the information you need, you're going to need a more complex system.

这是一种好的文件格式吗？嗯，它非常高效。但它也缺乏上下文。假设你班上的学生是谁。没有办法跟踪合理缺席等情况。要真正涵盖你需要的所有信息，你需要一个更复杂的系统。

But if you assume a simple present/absent mark for a fixed list of students, the above file format could theoretically suffice.

但如果你假设一个固定学生名单的简单出席/缺席标记，上述文件格式在理论上是足够的。

> **Interesting experiment 有趣的实验**
> Take an existing Word/Excel file, one with an "x" in the file extension (`.docx` or `.xlsx`). Change its file extension to `.zip` and try to open it. It... works!?
> 将现有的 Word/Excel 文件，即文件扩展名中带有 "x" 的文件（`.docx` 或 `.xlsx`），将其文件扩展名更改为 `.zip` 并尝试打开它。它...可以工作！？
> Since the advent of the new Office file formats, Word and Excel documents are really just secret zip archives, not custom binary file formats like they used to be. But by using a unique file extension instead of `.zip`, people can still configure these `.docx` or `.xlsx` files to be automatically opened using Word/Excel instead of however they've configured `.zip` files to be opened.
> 自从新的 Office 文件格式出现以来，Word 和 Excel 文档实际上只是秘密的 zip 档案，而不再是以前那种自定义的二进制文件格式。但是，通过使用独特的文件扩展名而不是`.zip`，人们仍然可以配置这些`.docx`或`.xlsx`文件，使其自动使用 Word/Excel 打开，而不是按照他们配置的`.zip`文件的打开方式。

## File name (and path) 文件名（和路径）

At its most basic level, a file name is just one long string of characters, nothing more.

在最基本的层面上，文件名只是一个长长的字符字符串，仅此而已。

Obviously, we're likely going to want to store more than one file on our computer. So we need a way to reference each file that we store. This is why we give them a name, to tell them apart. This is no different from why humans give eachother names.

显然，我们很可能想在计算机上存储多个文件。因此，我们需要一种方法来引用我们存储的每个文件。这就是我们给它们命名的原因，以便区分它们。这与人类为什么给彼此起名字没有什么不同。

As mentioned before, we add a file extension to the end of the name, so that we remind ourselves (and the OS) of the data structure that was used for the file content.

如前所述，我们在名称的末尾添加文件扩展名，以便提醒自己（和操作系统）文件内容所使用的数据结构。

But we often have a lot of files. We'd really like to organize them properly into little collections, instead of throwing them all on one big messy pile. To do this, we started prepending our filenames with what we call the "path".

但我们通常有很多文件。我们真的希望将它们妥善组织成小集合，而不是把它们全部扔在一个大杂乱的堆里。为此，我们开始在文件名之前加上我们称之为“路径”的东西。

A path is nothing more than a (back)slash-separated sequence of names which list the hierarchy of how we'd like to organize our files.

路径不过是一个由斜杠（或反斜杠）分隔的名称序列，列出了我们希望如何组织文件的层次结构。

The OS will take the file name, split the names into the separate chunks, and will use that hierarchical information to show your files in a neat and organized manner.

操作系统将获取文件名，将名称拆分成单独的部分，并利用这些层次信息以整齐有序的方式显示您的文件。

Every file's name is really just a combination of:

每个文件的名称实际上只是以下内容的组合：

```

[folder chunks][name of the file].[file extension]

```

Take the example of the following file names:

以下文件名的例子：

```

C:\Fruit\apple.txt

C:\People\PeopleILike\Tom.png

C:\Fruit\banana.txt

C:\People\PeopleIHate\Kevin.png

```

If you split the names in the chunks between the backslashes, you can start seeing the structure. For example, the first and third file have exactly the same chunks before their file name. Therefore, they belong in the same folder.

如果你将反斜杠之间的名称分开，你可以开始看到结构。例如，第一个和第三个文件在文件名之前有完全相同的块。因此，它们属于同一个文件夹。

The second and fourth file have a common first chunk, but then they have a different chunk. Therefore, they are found in the same parent directory but then live in a different subdirectory.

第二个和第四个文件有一个共同的第一个块，但随后它们有一个不同的块。因此，它们位于同一个父目录中，但在不同的子目录中。

If you apply this logic, just like how an OS does, you come up with the intended organisational structure:

如果你应用这种逻辑，就像操作系统一样，你会得出预期的组织结构：

```

C/

├─ Fruit/

│  ├─ apple.txt

│  ├─ banana.txt

├─ People/

│  ├─ PeopleIHate/

│  │  ├─ Kevin.png

│  ├─ PeopleILike/

│  │  ├─ Tom.png

```

We like to think of our file system as this neat nested system of folders and subfolders. But in the underlying file system, we don't actually store a "folder" by itself. A folder is really just generated dynamically based on the slash-separated chunks found in a file's name.

我们喜欢将我们的文件系统视为一个整齐的嵌套文件夹和子文件夹系统。但在底层文件系统中，我们实际上并不单独存储“文件夹”。文件夹实际上只是根据文件名中找到的斜杠分隔的部分动态生成的。

This leads to some interesting effects:

这会导致一些有趣的效果：

- Want to move a file? All you have to change is the file's path. You don't need to update a folder itself.

想要移动一个文件吗？您只需更改文件的路径即可。您不需要更新文件夹本身。

- Want to rename a folder? Then you're going to need to change this name in all of the files who contain this folder in their path.

想要重命名一个文件夹吗？那么你需要在所有包含该文件夹路径的文件中更改这个名称。

**This is an oversimplification**. File systems are more complicated than this, because you need the ability to e.g. create empty folders. But this is a good first explanation of how the file system works.

**这是一种过于简单化的说法**。文件系统比这复杂，因为你需要能够例如创建空文件夹。但这是对文件系统如何工作的一个很好的初步解释。

## File metadata 文件元数据

Next to the file name and content, there's more things we know about the file, such as when it was created, whether it is read-only, any permissions attached to the file, ... These things are not stored in the file content. They are an addendum to the file.

除了文件名和内容，我们还知道关于文件的更多信息，例如它的创建时间、是否为只读、与文件相关的任何权限等……这些信息并不存储在文件内容中。它们是文件的附录。

If you transfer a file from one file system to another, this data may be lost if the target system doesn't know how to work with the source system's metadata structure. However, this doesn't matter in terms of using the file itself. Your data is safe.

如果您将文件从一个文件系统转移到另一个文件系统，如果目标系统不知道如何处理源系统的元数据结构，则可能会丢失这些数据。然而，这在使用文件本身时并不重要。您的数据是安全的。

You might just lose track of e.g. when your file was created.

您可能会忘记例如您的文件是何时创建的。

- this is incorrect. A name is just the name of a single file or directory. What you describe as name is a path. Also, the name is part of the path.

这是不正确的。名称只是单个文件或目录的名称。你所描述的名称是路径。此外，名称是路径的一部分。 

- good, but I wouldn't start with "a series of ones and zeros" in the most basic explanation, since there's basically no simple way for students to view files as a series of ones and zeros.

好的，但我不会在最基本的解释中以“一系列的零和一”作为开头，因为学生基本上没有简单的方法将文件视为一系列的零和一。

I feel like starting with "a series of letters, numbers, and about 200 other symbols" will let them explore better, and next they can learn that these symbols are representations of ones and zeros.

我觉得从“一系列字母、数字和大约 200 个其他符号”开始，会让他们更好地探索，然后他们可以学习这些符号是 1 和 0 的表示。 

- @MichaelScottAsatoCuthbert *"a series of letters, numbers, and about 200 other symbols"* does not in my opinion adequately cover what a file is, it is one specific way (of countless many) of how a file can be interpreted.

@MichaelScottAsatoCuthbert *"一系列字母、数字和大约 200 个其他符号"* 在我看来并不能充分涵盖文件的定义，它只是文件可以被解释的无数种方式中的一种。

Yours is a more concrete example use case of a file and I agree that this helps with understanding the general purpose of a file; which is why my answer pretty much *immediately* discusses interpretation after stating that a file is a sequence of ones and zeroes; but it is not a good base definition of a file in and of itself.

你的例子是一个更具体的文件使用案例，我同意这有助于理解文件的一般目的；这就是为什么我的回答几乎 *立即* 在说明文件是由一系列的零和一组成后就讨论了解释；但这本身并不是一个好的文件基本定义。 

- @linuxUser123: The answer builds up the understanding of file names and paths step by step. I refer to the name (i.e. filename) first before then introducing paths which are used to further organizes these files (which up until then only had names, not paths).

@linuxUser123: 这个答案逐步建立了对文件名和路径的理解。我首先提到名称（即文件名），然后再介绍用于进一步组织这些文件的路径（在此之前这些文件只有名称，没有路径）。

The wording I used was intentionally chosen to be layman-readable. As mentioned in the final paragraph of that section, my explanation is an oversimplification. This answer favors layman-human-readability over technical pedantry.

我使用的措辞是故意选择的，以便普通人能够理解。正如该部分最后一段所提到的，我的解释是一个过于简单化的说法。这个答案更倾向于普通人可读性，而不是技术上的拘泥。

It should not be used as a technical reference, only as a basic grasp on the components at play.

它不应被用作技术参考，仅作为对相关组件的基本理解。 

A slightly different but insightful take on this :-

一个稍微不同但富有洞察力的看法：

On UNIX systems everything is a file. A file of data is a datafile but a directory (folder) is also a file. A device is a file (found in the /dev directory). Programs are executable files and even running program and system states have associated files (found in /run).

在 UNIX 系统中，一切都是文件。数据文件是数据文件，但目录（文件夹）也是一个文件。设备是一个文件（位于/dev 目录中）。程序是可执行文件，甚至正在运行的程序和系统状态也有相关的文件（位于/run 中）。

Network connections are files that can be read and written.

网络连接是可以读取和写入的文件。

I suppose that explains why its difficult to define what a file is. In a physical sense it is just a list of connected disk or tape or memory sectors containing codes for data values.

我想这解释了为什么很难定义什么是文件。从物理意义上讲，它只是一个连接的磁盘、磁带或内存扇区的列表，包含数据值的代码。

I'd actually answer this question from an *Intro* student from more of the **HCI perspective**, because they likely have more experience *using* a computer than understanding how the computer works. @MichelBillaud had a similar notion in suggesting it as an abstraction (although most intro students won't fully appreciate what abstraction means the point of asking what a file is). **Relating the abstraction to what they already understand in the physical world helps establish a good foundation.**

我实际上会从一个 *入门* 学生的 **人机交互** 角度来回答这个问题，因为他们可能在 *使用* 计算机方面有更多经验，而不是理解计算机是如何工作的。@MichelBillaud 在建议将其视为一种抽象时有类似的看法（尽管大多数入门学生不会完全理解抽象的含义，但提出文件是什么的问题是有意义的）。 **将抽象与他们在物理世界中已经理解的事物联系起来，有助于建立良好的基础。**

I'd start by explaining that the first personal computers with graphical interfaces ([Xerox Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Star) if they want a historical context) faced the challenge of making it easy for someone who works in an office learn how to work with a computer, which stores information digitally instead of on paper.

我会首先解释，第一台具有图形界面的个人电脑（如果他们想要历史背景，可以提到[施乐星](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Star)）面临的挑战是让在办公室工作的人容易学习如何使用计算机，而计算机是以数字方式存储信息，而不是纸质。

In an office, they might have records of a client's information that they'd traditionally write on a piece of paper and store it away in a file cabinet. That **file is a record of related information that you can look up by a name**. That metaphor works for computers. They store information electronically instead of on paper, but that **digital record is organized in one place and can be looked up by the file name**.

在办公室，他们可能会有客户信息的记录，传统上会写在纸上并存放在文件柜中。那个 **文件是可以通过名字查找的相关信息的记录**。这个比喻适用于计算机。它们以电子方式存储信息，而不是纸质的，但那个 **数字记录被组织在一个地方，可以通过文件名查找**。

From there, you can build upon that fundamental to explain different file formats (e.g. plain text vs binary) or how the metaphor extends to other abstractions of digital data represented in ways people can relate to in the physical world (e.g. folders, storage, copying/moving and recycle/trash, to [other WIMP metaphors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)).

从那里，您可以在此基础上解释不同的文件格式（例如，纯文本与二进制）或隐喻如何扩展到其他数字数据的抽象表示，这些表示方式与人们在物理世界中可以关联的方式（例如，文件夹、存储、复制/移动和回收/垃圾），以及[其他 WIMP 隐喻](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing))。

- Great explanation! Now we just need to re-base it to a world where people never used paper files, folders, desks, offices... What does "a record of clients information" mean to someone who has not used paper for that, or really know what a client is?

很好的解释！现在我们只需要将其重新建立在一个人们从未使用纸质文件、文件夹、桌子、办公室的世界中……对于一个从未使用纸张记录客户信息的人，或者真的不知道客户是什么，这“客户信息的记录”意味着什么呢？

Children truly face a crazy learning situation, and they always have, but now things have changed so much in one lifetime that our teaching is way behind. How do we get ahead of their already lived experience in order to show them where things are going? I bet we can't.

孩子们确实面临着一个疯狂的学习环境，他们一直都是如此，但现在在一个人的一生中，情况发生了如此大的变化，以至于我们的教学远远落后。我们如何超越他们已经经历的经验，以向他们展示未来的发展方向？我敢打赌我们做不到。

So we have to explain clearly where things came from and hope for the best.

所以我们必须清楚地解释事情的来源，并希望一切顺利。 

A file is a **metaphor**, representing a **mental model** that would be familiar to office workers who were the initial users of computing systems.

一个文件是一个**隐喻**，代表了一个**心理模型**，这对于最初使用计算机系统的办公室工作人员来说是熟悉的。

Different users in a different context require different metaphors as they have different mental models.

不同的用户在不同的环境中需要不同的隐喻，因为他们有不同的心理模型。

This is by far the best answer, cutting through all the detail to the real issue: files don't actually exist. (Folders doubly so.) No one has seen one at any time, they are a made up idea in a made up system in... a made up world.

这无疑是最好的答案，切中要害：文件实际上并不存在。（文件夹更是如此。）没有人曾见过它们，它们是一个虚构系统中虚构的概念，在……一个虚构的世界里。

Until someone gets it that we invented everything except gravity and the integers, they will not see the way in which this question could even arise.

直到有人明白我们发明了一切，除了重力和整数，他们才会看到这个问题甚至会出现的方式。 

Wasn't it Pascal who said something like: *Geometry is not 'true', it is convenient.*

难道不是帕斯卡尔说过类似的话吗：*几何不是“真实的”，而是方便的。*

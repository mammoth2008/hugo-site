I know its probably my fault to obsess with it, it was a learning experience overall and that's why I am sharing this. Remember: Boundaries are for my well-being, not for punishment.
我知道这大概是我的错，执着于此，但总的来说这是一次学习经历，这也是我分享的原因。记住：界限是为了我的健康，而不是为了惩罚。

So, I went offline to reduce the noise and I expected clarity, instead I found boredom and an obsession with tracking - as if the low number would mean progress.
于是我断网以减少噪音，我期待着清晰，却发现了无聊和对追踪的执着——仿佛低数字意味着进步。

From absence I learned to see, and that guilt is just another form of being controlled. Now I'm here, into the other side of this experience, feeling a bit foolish but also wiser.
从缺席中我学会了看见，而内疚只是另一种控制形式。现在我处于这次经历的另一边，感觉有点愚蠢，但也更明智了。

Now, I return not to distraction but to discernment.
现在，我回归的不是分心，而是辨别力。

I use my phone like I use a notebook, a sketchpad, a compass.
我像使用笔记本、画板、指南针一样使用我的手机。

I don’t count minutes. My phone isn’t the enemy. Mindless use is. I’m not here to track time, but to make something out of it.
我不计算时间。我的手机不是敌人。无意识的用法才是。我这里不是要追踪时间，而是要利用它创造出一些东西。
